# Port Operations Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing port operations. It explores cargo volume, ship traffic, turnaround time, and efficiency metrics to help optimize port performance.

## 📊 Features
- **Cargo Volume Analysis**: Total cargo handled by port and type.
- **Ship Traffic Trends**: Monthly and yearly trends in ship arrivals.
- **Turnaround Time Insights**: Average time ships spend in port.
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) for port operations.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Port locations and operational statistics.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File:** `Port_Operations_Dataset.xlsx`
- **Columns:** Port Name, Cargo Type, Volume (Tons), Ship Arrivals, Turnaround Time (Hours), Efficiency Score, Date
- **Size:** Large dataset covering multiple ports and years
